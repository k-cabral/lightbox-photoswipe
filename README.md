# Lightbox with PhotoSwipe (K Mod)

This is a simple mod to the original plugin with two key differences:
- Add a toggleable filter to wrap all images with links unless they have a CSS class set (configurable, 'no-gallery' by default);
- Configurable zoom options for PhotoSwipe 5.

Check the [original README](/README.old.md) for more info.
